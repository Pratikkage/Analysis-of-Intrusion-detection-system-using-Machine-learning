# 🔐 Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning

## 📝 Overview
As digital networks and internet use expand, the risk of data breaches and cyber threats has surged, making robust data security more essential than ever. An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a crucial security tool, continuously monitoring network traffic, identifying suspicious activities, and alerting administrators to potential security breaches.

This project enhances IDS capabilities using machine learning to classify network intrusions in real-time with high accuracy. Leveraging the **KDD train and test datasets**, we evaluate various machine learning models to identify the best-performing algorithm for intrusion detection.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
With the growing use of computers, mobile, and IoT devices, cyber-attacks increasingly threaten network integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Traditional firewalls often fail to detect sophisticated threats, necessitating a more advanced approach. This project aims to build a machine learning-based **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** to classify network traffic as normal or malicious. By leveraging anomaly-based detection, this system identifies both known and unknown attacks, providing proactive security.

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were evaluated for effectiveness in detecting network intrusions:
- 🤖 Logistic Regression
- 🔍 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- 🌳 Random Forest
- 🧮 Gaussian Naive Bayes
- 🌲 Decision Tree
- 🛡️ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 🧠 Neural Networks
- 🚀 XGBoost

## 📊 Datasets
The **KDD train and test datasets** are used for training and testing, serving as a benchmark for IDS model evaluation.
